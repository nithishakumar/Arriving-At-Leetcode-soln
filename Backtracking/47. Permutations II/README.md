# 47. Permutations II ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…ðŸ¤£ -> ðŸ¤£ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…

We need to generate all possible arrangements of a set of numbers with duplicates. 

Why we can't use the visited logic described in Permutations I: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8vQqeoKrbY

Use the same logic described in Permutations I (https://github.com/nithishakumar/arriving-at-DSA-solns/tree/main/Backtracking/46.%20Permutations) but avoid generating duplicate permutations by using an unordered_map.

To generate permutations in sorted order, we can use a map instead of an unordered_map to store elements in sorted order.
